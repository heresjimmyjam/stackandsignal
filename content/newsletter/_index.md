Stack & Signal is a personal newsletter about building things, staying curious, and paying attention to what actually matters.

Each issue is a short letter: a project I shipped, a tool that changed how I work, or a link that made me think differently. I write when I have something to share.

I'm not trying to keep up with the news cycle or chase trends. Just trying to notice what's interesting and share it with people who might feel the same.
