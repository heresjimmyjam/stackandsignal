I'm Jimmy. I work in marketing technology by day — leading a small team that keeps the sales and marketing tech stack running my chosen software company. It's the kind of work where you're constantly translating between systems that don't want to talk to each other and people who have very different ideas about what "done" means.

Outside of that, I spend my time 3D printing, learning photography, brewing too much coffee, and tinkering with side projects when I can. I'm a dad to two kids and live in San Diego with my wife.

## What is this place?

Stack & Signal is my little corner of the internet — a place to share what I'm building, what I'm learning, and what's been worth my attention lately.

I started it because I wanted a home base that wasn't rented from a platform designed to keep me scrolling. Somewhere I could post a project, a half-formed thought, or a link that reframed something for me — without wondering if an algorithm would bury it.

The "stack" is the layers of tools and systems I work with. The "signal" is the attempt to find something worth saying in all the noise.

I'm not trying to keep up with the news cycle or chase trends. Just trying to notice what's interesting and share it with people who might feel the same.

## Newsletter

Each issue is a short letter: a project I shipped, a tool that changed how I work, or a link that made me think differently. I write when I have something to share.

If that sounds good to you, I'd love to have you along.
