    <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Jimmy. I work in marketing technology by day, leading a small team that keeps the sales and marketing tech stack running at my chosen software company. It&rsquo;s the kind of work where you&rsquo;re constantly translating between systems that don&rsquo;t want to talk to each other and people who have very different ideas about what &ldquo;done&rdquo; means.</p>
<p>Outside of that, I spend my time 3D printing, learning photography, brewing too much coffee, and tinkering with side projects when I can. I&rsquo;m a dad to two kids and live in San Diego with a house full of 3 cats and a dog.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-this-place">What is this place?</h2>
<p>Stack &amp; Signal is my little corner of the internet, a place to share what I&rsquo;m building, what I&rsquo;m learning, and what&rsquo;s been worth my attention lately.</p>
<p>I started it because I wanted a home base that wasn&rsquo;t rented from a platform designed to keep me scrolling. Somewhere I could post a project, a half-formed thought, or a link that reframed something for me, without wondering if an algorithm would bury it.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;stack&rdquo; is the layers of tools and systems I work with. The &ldquo;signal&rdquo; is the attempt to find something worth saying in all the noise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to keep up with the news cycle or chase trends. Just trying to notice what&rsquo;s interesting and share it with people who might feel the same.</p>
<h2 id="newsletter">Newsletter</h2>
<p>Each issue is a short letter: a project I shipped, a tool that changed how I work, or a link that made me think differently. I write when I have something to share.</p>
<p>If that sounds good to you, I&rsquo;d love to have you along.</p>
