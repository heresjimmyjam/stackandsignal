        <p>I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that doing quick calculations in my head has never been my strong suit.</p>
<p>So when I got my new french press (an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-french-press/">Espro P3</a>, if you&rsquo;re curious) and the instructions threw out ratio suggestions based on roast level, I got a headache. I just wanted coffee. Instead I was staring at a bag of beans trying to do division.</p>
<p>So I built a calculator to do the math for me.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>You pick your roast level, which sets a default ratio. Light roasts are denser and extract differently than dark roasts, so they need less water. A 1:15 ratio versus 1:17 for dark. I knew the basics, but building this sent me down a small rabbit hole confirming the details.</p>
<p>Then you enter either how much coffee you have (grams) or how much water you want (oz/ml) to end up with. It calculates the other. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>For me, the use case is simple: I want two cups of coffee in the morning. I enter the water amount, and it tells me how many grams of beans to grind. No thinking required, which is the whole point before caffeine kicks in.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-built-it">How I built it</h2>
<p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a lot of help from Claude. I&rsquo;m many things, but a proficient coder isn&rsquo;t one of them. AI made this possible in an afternoon instead of a frustrating weekend.</p>
<h2 id="what-id-change">What I&rsquo;d change</h2>
<p>Nothing, and that&rsquo;s intentional.</p>
<p>My problem has always been overcomplicating personal projects. Adding features, anticipating edge cases, building for users who don&rsquo;t exist. I&rsquo;m trying to learn to make simpler things and appreciate them for what they are. This calculator solves my problem. It&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>I also considered only including dark roast since that&rsquo;s what I drink. But who am I to ignore people with other preferences and a similar disposition toward mental math?</p>
